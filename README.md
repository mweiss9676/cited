# cited

### what? 

Cited is an appliation that allows independent commentary "journalists" to categorize, tag and curate their references.
Users can then take these references and build collections of comments with cited references. 

### why?

Online discource in forums like reddit and comments on YouTube videos and the like are filled with uninformed, uncited opinions, masking themselves as fact and Cited is intended to provide users a simple way to elevate their online discourse. 

### how? 

Cited will allow users to: 
* Import links from online articles and save them as cited references 
    * Users can save comments to these articles
    * Users can tag articles
         * tags will automatically provide a way to categorize subjects
         * if possible it would be great to use a machine learning api to automatically scan these articles to suggest tags
         * if possible it would be great to use a machine learning api to summarize articles
     * Users can add reminder notifications to alert them after a certain amount of time has passed
         * this will allow them to set themselves reminders to update their comments when major events occur such as political trials or the like
         * it would be great to automate reminders when major news occurs involving a users tags (probably more of a phase 2 task)
     * These items would become Citations which are individual collections of comment citation pairs
         * cited would allow a user to create new comments by appending these citations to one another, thus generating new "comments" 
         * citations would have the domain of the links listed in their footer in order to provide an at-a-glance view of the scholarly credentials of each citation.
